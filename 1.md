# Python
Before we dive into the algorithms, we need to have a strong foundation in at least one programming language. 

Python is a popular language for technical interviews because of its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Here are a few reasons why Python is a good choice for technical interviews:

1. Simple syntax: Python has a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, which makes it easier to write and read code. This simplicity allows interviewers to quickly assess a candidate's coding skills without getting bogged down in complex syntax.

2. Large community: Python has a vast and active community of developers who contribute to a variety of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This makes it easier for candidates to find resources and support when preparing for interviews.

3. Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more. This versatility makes it a useful tool for many types of technical interviews.

Overall, Python's simplicity, versatility, and availability of resources make it a popular choice for technical interviews.
