# Math and Geometry
This section will go over common math and geometry problems.

## Math to Know
### Combinations
Number of combinations of different elements for different categories:
- $x * y * z * ...$ where x, y, z, ... are the number of different elements corresponding to unique categories.

Permutations: $\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$ - strings of length k from alphabet of size n, where characters can not be repeated and order matters.

Combinations: (n choose k) = $\frac{n!}{((n - k)! * k!)}$ - form teams of size k from n people, where characters cannot be repeated and order doesn't matter.

### Elementary Operations
Both multiplication and addition utilize a `carry`, where if the addition of two numbers is greater than 9, $a + b > 9$, then the carry == 1; else, the carry == 0. 
- If the carry is 1, then you need to add it to the `i + 1` digit (place), given that `i` is the current digit (place) that you are summing. 

Addition over an array can be optimized using the Gauss' Summation:
$$1 + 2 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
$$x + (x + 1) + ... + n = \frac{(x - n + 1)(x + n)}{2}$$

The power function is inherently recursive:
- If the power is even, then $2^x = 2 ^ {(x / 2)} * 2 ^ {(x / 2)}$
- If the power is odd, then $2^{(x + 1)} = 2 ^ {(x / 2)} * 2 ^ {(x / 2)} * 2$
- The base cases are the 0th power and the 1st power.
