# Classes and Additional Syntax Tips
Classes in Python are very similar to classes in other programming languages. Below is a code block that navigate through the syntax of defining classes in Python. 

```{code-block} python

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age): # Constructor
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __str__(self): # String Representation
        return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
    
    def myfunc(self): # Define any more functions below
        print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36) # Create an class instance named John who is 36 years old

p1.myfunc() # Call myfunc for p1
```

## Instance Attributes
Since Python is a dynamically typed language, just like JavaScript, Perl, and PHP, you can add instance attributes to an object at runtime. For example, assume there is a TreeNode class with the attributes `self.val`, `self.left`, and `self.right`. We create an instance of the class using `node = TreeNode(0)`. Then, we can add an instance attribute named `par` to the instance like so: `node.par = TreeNode(0)`. We never defined a `par` attribute in the class definition, but we are still allowed to give an instance a `par` attribute. 

# Syntax Tips
1. If you are not using a variable that is either returned or used for iteration, you can assign values to `_`.
