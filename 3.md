# Strings, Arrays, and Hashing
Problems involving strings, arrays, and/or hashmaps (dictionaries) involve many different strategies and algorithms to solve them. 

The sections in this chapter talk about some of the most commonly used algorithms to solve these types of problems. 

## Before the Problem
Before going into the problem, think about what transformations you can perform on the input that are most appropriate:

### Sorting
Sorting is a common transformation that is not typically part of an optimal solution but can help you solve the question. 

### Data Structures
Array (List)
- Counting the frequency of characters in a string when paired with `ord(<char>)`

Set
- Eliminating duplicates
- Performing intersections and unions
- Lookup/insert/delete in O(1) average for elements

Tuple
- Immutable
- Hashable, which means that it can be used as a key in a dictionary

Dictionary
- Counting the frequency of things
- Lookup/insert/delete in O(1) average

## During the Problem
Some small but meaningful things to look out for:
- If two arrays are the known to have the same length, can iterate them in parallel
- Counting can go both ways: adding to count or subtracting to count (0 is equalizing)
- If can be solved in two passes, try to think of a solution that only needs one pass (because it probably exists)

## General Tips
Here are some strategies to solving general types of array and hashing problems:
1. Computing the frequency/count of characters/elements in a string or an array in a hashmap (dictionary) can be useful for many problems. 
2. Converting integers to strings using `str()` can allow for easy processing for digits in a number.
