# Intervals
This section will go over interval problems, e.g. `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..]`

## Here are some tips:
1. Sorting the list of intervals will order the intervals by starting elements, a[0], which can simplify many interval questions. 
2. When you are merging intervals together and dealing with an output array/space, you can easily just modify the last interval in the output array by changing the end # to the max(output[-1][1], interval[1]) if the interval is overlapping. 
3. For any overlapping intervals, either compare to previous interval stored in some array, or indexed, or compare to next interval. 
3. For intersections, the interval with the smallest endpoint should be discarded (moved to the next one). For maximal non-overlapping, keep the interval with the smallest endpoint.
