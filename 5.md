# Linked Lists
Problems involving Linked Lists involve many different strategies and algorithms to solve them. 

The sections in this chapter talk about some of the most commonly used algorithms to solve these types of problems. 

## Before the Problem
Before going into the problem, think about what transformations you can perform on the input/output that are most appropriate:

### Sentinel (Dummy) Node
A sentinel, or dummy, node is essentially a placeholder node typically created at the beginning of some output, which can handle some edge cases. 
- Initialized as `Node(0, None)`
- When you return the output, make sure to return `head.next` as to not include the dummy node in your output

## Algorithms
### Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
This algorithm utilizes two pointers that moves at the same time: a fast pointer and a slow pointer. 
- The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer: `fast = fast.next.next`
- The slow pointer moves similarly to iteration: `slow = slow.next`

This algorithm can find the middle node of the linked list:
- When the fast pointer hits the end of the Linked List, the slow pointer should be at the middle node. 

This algorithm is useful for cycle detection:
- If the fast pointer reaches None (e.g. `not fast or not fast.next`), then there is no cycle. 
- If the fast pointer equals the slow pointer, then there is a cycle (not at the beginning)

This algorithm can also find the beginning of a cycle:
- At the node where the fast pointer equals the slow pointer, the distance from the start of the LL to the beginning of the cycle is the same as the node to the beginning of the cycle. 

### Reverse Linked List
This algorithm is useful in several Linked List problems. 
- Maintain a temp, curr, and prev pointer

## General Tips
Here are some strategies to solving general types of linked list problems:
1. Maintaining two pointers can be useful for many problems, e.g. iterating at different speeds, starting at different positions, etc.
2. Some problems can be more easily solved using recursion
