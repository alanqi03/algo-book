# Trees
Problems involving trees involve many different strategies and algorithms to solve them. 

The sections in this chapter talk about some of the most commonly used algorithms to solve these types of problems. 
# Trees
A tree is defined as a connected, undirected graph with no cycles.
- A tree with `n` nodes will always have `(n - 1)` edges. 

## Binary Trees
We will introduce the binary tree, which is a common type of tree used in many problems.

In Python, we can define a binary tree as a Node class as shown:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
