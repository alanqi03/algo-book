# Graphs
A graph consists of nodes (also called vertices) that are connected by edges (also called arcs).
- Two nodes that are connected by an edge are called neighbors.
- Make sure to not revisit nodes so you don't get stuck in an infinite loop!

## Breadth First Search
BFS in graphs is exactly the same as how it is done in trees. 
- If used in a graph, a boolean array is needed in order to not visit the same nodes. 
- Uses a queue
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def BFS(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        //do pre-processing of queue
        node = queue.popleft()
        //do post-processing of node
        for v in node.neighbors:
            queue.append(v)
```

## Depth First Search
DFS in graphs is exactly the same as how it is done in trees. 
- Implemented iteratively using a stack instead of a queue (same code as BFS)
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def DFS(root):
    //processing with root
    for v in root.neighbors:
        DFS(root)
```
