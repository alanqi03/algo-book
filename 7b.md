# Topological Sorting and Union Find
Both topological sorting and union find are algorithms/strategies for solving some graph problems. 

## Topological Sorting
Topological Sorting is the process of sorting the vertices in a graph such that given vertices u and v, to reach vertex v, we must have reached vertex u. Therefore, u has to appear before v in the ordering given by topological sorting. 
- This will only work with DAG (Directed, Acyclic Graph)
- Can detect a cycle in a directed graph if the algorithm doesn't order ALL nodes in the graph. 

Here is the code for topological sort.
- Note: indegree refers to the number of edges pointing into some node. 
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def topo_sort(edges):
    node_indegree = defaultdict(int)
    neighbors = defaultdict(list)
    q = deque()
    for x, y in edges:
        node_indegree[y] += 1
        neighbors[x].append(y)
    for node, indegree in node_indegree.items():
        if indegree == 0:
            q.append(node)
    ordering = []
    while q:
        node = q.popleft()
        ordering.append(node)
        for nei in neighbors[node]:
            node_indegree[nei] -= 1
            if node_indegree[nei] == 0:
                q.append(node)
    return ordering
```
The code accomplishes the following steps in order:
- Store the indegree and the neighbors of each node
- Append all nodes with indegree 0 to the queue
- While the q exists:
    - Pop node from the queue, and decrement the indegree of its neighbors
    - If the indegree becomes 0, then append to the queue

### Problems
1. Course Schedule
2. Course Schedule II

## Union Find
A union find is a data structure that keeps track of elements (nodes) which are split into one or more disjoint sets (connected components)
It has two primary operations: **find** and **union**:
- **find(x)** will return the parent node of x, which is the highest ancestor of node x. This is an amortized α(N) time complexity, the inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant even for large N. 
- **union(x, y)** will "union" the parent node of x and the parent node of y, by pointing parent node of x to parent node of y. Same time complexity as find. 

Here is the code for the Union Find (DSU) data structure:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
class DSU():
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.par = [i for i in range(size)]
    def find(self, x):
        if self.par[x] != x:
            self.par[x] = self.find(self.par[x])
        return self.par[x]
    def union(self, x, y):
        x_par, y_par = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        self.par[x_par] = y_par
```
Walking through each method:
- `def __init__(self, size)` will generate a `self.par` variable, which will essentially map each node to its "parent", which is the highest ancestor. 
    - You can also use a dictionary
- `def find(self, x)` will find the "parent" of x; in the mean time, it performs path compression by setting the parent of x to the highest ancestor. 
- `def union(self, x, y)` will just set the "parent" of x to the "parent of y", if possible. 

Union Find is useful in many different applications:
- Finding which edge(s) create cycles
- Connected Components
- Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- Tree Validation

### Problems
1. Redundant Connection
2. Number of Connected Components in An Undirected Graph
3. Graph Valid Tree
