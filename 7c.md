# Minimum Spanning Trees
This section will go over algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree for graphs, which are used in several graph problems.
- Before you begin this section, please review union find, which will be utilized in Kruskal's algorithm. 

## Minimum Spanning Tree
The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) defined for a graph is a subset of edges that connect all vertices while the total weights of these edges are minimum among all possible subsets.
There are two common algorithms to solve for the MST of a graph:
- Kruskal's Algorithm, which utilizes union find and edge sorting
- Prim's Algorithm

### Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds a MST in a weighted, undirected graph.
- The runtime of this algorithm is typically bounded by sorting all edges. 

The steps for this algorithm are as follows:
1. Define the Union Find (DSU) data structure
2. Generate all possible edges in the graph and sort them by weight
3. Iterate through the sorted edges, union nodes until `n-1` edges chosen. 

Here is the following code:
```{code-block} python

class DSU:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.par = list(range(size))
    def find(self, x):
        if self.par[x] != x:
            self.par[x] = self.find(self.par[x])
        return self.par[x]
    def union(self, x, y):
        x_par, y_par = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if x_par == y_par:
            return False
        self.par[x_par] = y_par
        return True

class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(points)
        all_edges = []
        for i in range(n): #generates all possible edges (distance between two points)
            x = points[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                y = points[j]
                dist = abs(y[1] - x[1]) + abs(y[0] - x[0])
                all_edges.append((dist, i, j))
        all_edges.sort() #sorts the edges
        num_edges = 0
        weight = 0
        dsu = DSU(n)
        for dist, x, y in all_edges: #performs unions until the num_edges = n - 1
            if num_edges == n - 1:
                break
            if dsu.union(x, y):
                num_edges += 1
                weight += dist
        return weight
```

### Prim's Algorithm
Prim's Algorithm is also a greedy algorithm that builds a MST in a weighted, undirected graph. 

The steps for this algorithm are as follows:
1. Start with an arbitrary node. 
2. Calculate all edge weights, if needed, to neighboring nodes
3. Connect to the node with lowest edge weight
4. Repeat steps 2-3 (the order can also be changed depending on how you coded the solution)

The data structure determines the time complexity of Prim's algorithm:
- Linear search is typically optimal if edges are not given (O($V^2$))
- Heap search is typically optimal if edges are given (Elog(V))

I present the Prim's algorithm using linear search:
```{code-block} python

linenos:

class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(points)
        edges_used = 0
        mst_cost = 0

        in_mst = [False] * n
        min_dist = [float('inf')] * n
        min_dist[0] = 0

        while edges_used < n:
            curr_min_edge = float('inf')
            curr_node = -1
            for next_node in range(n):
                if not in_mst[next_node] and curr_min_edge > min_dist[next_node]:
                    curr_min_edge = min_dist[next_node]
                    curr_node = next_node
            mst_cost += curr_min_edge
            edges_used += 1
            in_mst[curr_node] = True

            for next_node in range(n):
                weight = abs(points[curr_node][0] - points[next_node][0]) +\
                         abs(points[curr_node][1] - points[next_node][1])
                if not in_mst[next_node] and min_dist[next_node] > weight:
                    min_dist[next_node] = weight
        return mst_cost
```
