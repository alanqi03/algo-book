# Dictionaries and Heaps
## Dictionaries
A dictionary, also known as a hash table in Java, is a data structure that stores (key, value) pairs. 

The following code block will walk you through the syntax of dictionaries in Python. 
```{code-block} python

dict = {} # Create an empty dictionary

dict["Boba"] = "Tea" # Create a (key, value) pair called ("Boba", "Tea")

del dict["Boba"] # Delete the (key, value) pair in dict

tea = dict["Boba"] or dict.get("Boba") # Accesses the corresponding value of the specified key

if "Boba" in dict: # Determines if a key exists in a dictionary
    return True

list(dict) # Returns a list of all keys
list(dict.values()) # Returns a list of all values

for key, value in <dict>.items(): # Iterates through all (key, value) pairs
```
### How is a Dictionary Typically Implemented?
Here are the steps of how a dictionary is typically implemented:
1. Apply a hash function on the key; if the key is an integer, `% <large prime number>` is typically used
2. The hash key generated will map to a `Bucket`, which is typically an `array` or a `linkedlist`
3. From there, you store the `(k, v)` pair into the Bucket
4. All operations involving dictionaries involve iterating through the bucket, adding/updating/removing `(k, v)` pairs. 

### Types of Dictionaries
If you are allowed to import from the collections module, there are some very useful types of dictionaries. 

Sometimes, it is useful to use dictionaries that have default values. 
```{code-block} python

from collections import defaultdict

a = defaultdict(int) # Creates an empty dictionary with 0 as the default value for keys
b = defaultdict(list) # Creates an empty dictionary with empty list ([]) as the default value
```

It may also be useful to have dictionaries that automatically count all elements in an iterable. 
```{code-block} python

from collections import Counter

a = Counter(["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c"]) # a = {"a": 2, "b": 2, "c": 2}
```
The main advantages of Counter() over a dictionary is
1. They return a zero count for missing items instead of raising a KeyError. 
2. `Counter(<iterable>)` will automatically group elements and count them. 
3. `<counter>.most_common(n)` will return a list of n most common elements. 
4. `<counter>.total()` returns the total count. 

## Heaps (Priority Queues)
Heaps, also known as priority queues, are useful data structures for accessing minimum or maximum elements of a list. 
They can also be used to extract elements in a sorted fashion. 

The `heapq` class implements a min heap in Python. In order to implement a max heap, multiply values that you add into the heap by -1 and do the same when extracting values. 
```{code-block} python

a = [elements...] # Can be any iterable

heapq.heapify(a) # Makes the variable a into a min heap

heapq.heappush(a, <value>) # Adds <value> into the min heap

a[0] # Access min value 

heapq.heappop(a) # Removes the min value

heapq.heappushpop(a, <value>) # Removes the min value and adds the <value> to the heap

heapq.nlargest(n, a, key=None) # Removes the n largest elements in heap depending on key if specified

heapq.nsmallest(n, a, key=None) # Removes the n smallest elements in heap depending on key if specified
```

### Runtime of a Heap
The runtime of operations for a heap are not self explanatory, so here is a table about them.
| Operation | Runtime |
| -- | -- |
| Adding (Pushing) | O(logN) |
| Popping (Removing) | O(logN) |
| Add N elements | O(NlogN) |
