# Sliding Window
This section will go over the sliding window approach to solving array and string problems. 

## When to use
1. The input to the problem is a linear data structure such as linked list, array, or most commonly a string.
2. You're asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value given a particular condition. 

## Algorithm
The most common implementation of sliding window involves the following:
1. You typically have a "left" index (start) = 0, and then iterate with a "right" index through the linear data structure. 
2. You typically keep track of some calculated value of the elements between and including the "left" and "right" index.
3. Once your calculated value exceeds some value, the solution is no longer a valid solution, so you "resize" the window by incrementing the "left" index or even decrementing the "right" index. 
4. Find the maximum/minimum length of the sliding window such that it is a valid solution. 

## Example Problems
1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (M)
2. Longest Repeating Character Replacement (M)
3. Permutation In String (M)
4. Minimum Window Substring (H)
5. Sliding Window Maximum (H)
