# Stacks
This section will go over problems that are easily solvable using the stack data structure. 

## When to use
1. Nested elements in an array: operations in a calculator, parentheses
2. When a problem involves monotonically increasing or decreasing elements

## Data Structure
Stacks typically either store single elements or tuples (e.g. (a, b)). 
- Tuples can conveniently keep track of any combination of local minima, maxima, index, and value

Some advantages of stacks include:
- Most problems will typically compare some value with the top-most element of the stack (e.g. stack[-1])
- Monotonic stack: can keep track of the local maxima or local minima element in some array by appending only when greater or less than top-most element of stack. 
- Stacks are also very useful for elements of the "destructive" or "combining" nature, e.g. (5 + 3) becomes 8, two meteors hit each other and break, etc.

## Example Problems
1. Valid Parentheses (E)
2. Min Stack (M)
3. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (M)
4. Generate Parentheses (M)
5. Daily Temperatures (M)
6. Car Fleet (M)
- Hint: Given two cars and their time to target (distance-position/speed), if t1 < t2, then t1 can "reach" t2 before target, but if t1 >= t2, then t1 can never "reach" t2. 
7. Largest Rectangle in Histogram (H)
