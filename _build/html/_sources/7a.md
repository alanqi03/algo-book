# Using BFS and DFS in a Matrix (Graph)
A matrix can be represented as a graph, where each cell typically has four neighbors: top, bottom, left, and right adjacent cells.

There are a lot of interesting problems utilizing a matrix that can be solved by using BFS or DFS. 

## BFS
Recall that BFS stands for Breadth First Search and explores level-by-level outward. 

Given a matrix `board`, where you want to execute BFS from specific nodes, (row, col), in order to accomplish some tasks like so:
- Fill nodes with closest distance to specific nodes
- Simulating disease spread
- Finding the closest exit

Here is the following skeleton code to accomplish BFS:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
q = deque()
visited = set()
for r in range(m):
    for c in range(n):
        if board[r][c] == <x>:
            q.append((r, c))
directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
while q:
    //do pre-processing of queue
    node = queue.popleft()
    //do post-processing of node
    for row_diff, col_diff in directions:
        //perform checks for out of bounds
        //check whether already visited
        queue.append(v)
```

For the different tasks, you will typically keep track of some variables in the process of the BFS:
- For closest distance, you will iterate some `distance` variable by 1 per level
- For simulating disease spread, you will probably need a `time` variable to keep track of time passed (e.g. 1 min/level). 

## DFS
Recall that DFS stands for Depth First Search and explores as deep as possible before backtracking.

DFS is typically used instead of BFS when trying to find specific nodes that satisfy some condition without needing to go level by level.
- If you don't need to use BFS, then just use DFS.

Here is the following skeleton code to accomplish DFS:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def DFS(r, c):
    visited.add((r, c))
    //if board[r][c] met some condition(s), return it or add to array
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    for row_diff, col_diff in directions:
        new_row = r + row_diff
        new_col = c + col_diff
        if 0 <= new_row < len(board) and 0 <= new_col < len(board[0]) and (new_row, new_col) not in visited:
            dfs(new_row, new_col)

for r in range(m):
    for c in range(n):
        if board[r][c] == <x>:
            DFS(r, c)

```
