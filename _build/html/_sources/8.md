# Heap
This section will go over problems that can be solved using the heap data structure. 

## `heapq` Library
The `heapq` library in Python will be very useful for solving these types of problems. 
Here are the most relevant methods:
- `heapq.heapify(var)` will transform an iterable variable `var` (e.g. []) into a **min** heap
- `heap[0]` will return the min value (root)
- `heapq.heappush(heap, val)` will push the `val` onto the `heap`
- `heapq.heappop(heap)` will pop the min root 
- `heapq.heappushpop(heap, val)` will push the `val` onto the `heap` and remove/return the min value at the root
- `heapq.nlargest(n, heap, key=None)` will return the n largest elements in the heap based on a key, if defined
- `heapq.nsmallest(n, heap, key=None)` will return the n smallest elements in the heap based on a key, if defined

You can transform this heap into a max heap if you multiple every val added by -1. 

## Big O Complexity of a Heap
O(logN) push, O(logN) pop, O(NlogN) push all elements

## General Tips
Here are some general tips for using heaps:
- For k largest/smallest element, in order to optimize, you can limit the size of the minHeap/maxHeap to k and the root will be the kth element. 
- If you store tuples in the heap, the heap will sort by first element in tuple and break ties with second element
    - Knowing this fact, you can compare the "value" by storing it as the first element in a tuple and a "key" or "id" as the second element in a tuple.
