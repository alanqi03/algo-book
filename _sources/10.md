# Backtracking
The backtracking algorithm is typically used for the following problems: "Generate/Return all possible x (permutation/combination)"

## Permutations
This is the standard backtracking algorithm that will generate all permutations (order matters) of a certain size k and with repeating elements:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def permutations(self, nums):
    output = []
    def backtrack(sol=[]):
        //check if solution is valid, then add to solutions
        if len(sol) == k:
            output.append(sol[:])
            return
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            sol.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(sol)
            sol.pop()
```
- The core of this algorithm is appending an element, then calling backtrack, and finally popping the element
    - This enables backtrack to generate different combinations and explore a possible solution

For generating all permutations of a certain size k (without repeating elements):
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        output = []
        def backtrack(sol=[]):
            if len(sol) == len(nums):
                output.append(sol[:])
                return
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[i] not in sol:
                    sol.append(nums[i])
                    backtrack(sol)
                    sol.pop()
        backtrack()
        return output
```

## Combinations
For generating combinations (order doesn't matter)
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def combinations(self, nums):
    output = []
    def backtrack(first=0, sol=[]):
        //check if solution is valid, then add to solutions
        if len(sol) == k:
            output.append(sol[:])
            return
        for i in range(first, len(nums)):
            sol.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i, sol) //backtrack(i + 1, sol) if you cannot use the same element more than once
            sol.pop()
```
- This avoids repeats because we are no longer able to use an element that we have used already with `i + 1`

If you must generate combinations that avoid duplicate solutions (because of repeating elements in the set),
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def combinations(self, nums):
    output = []
    //sort to put duplicates together
    nums.sort()
    def backtrack(first=0, sol=[]):
        //check if solution is valid, then add to solutions
        if len(sol) == k:
            output.append(sol[:])
            return
        for i in range(first, len(nums)):
            //if avoiding duplicate solutions due to repeating elements 
            if i != first and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            sol.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i + 1, sol)
            sol.pop()

```
- Sorting will place all duplicate elements in the possible set together
- The for loop will avoid duplicate solutions by avoiding duplicate elements

If you must generate combinations of varying lengths,
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def combinations(self, nums):
    output = []
    def backtrack(first=0, sol=[]):
        //check if solution is valid, then add to solutions
        if len(sol) == k:
            output.append(sol[:])
            return
        for i in range(first, len(nums)):
            sol.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i + 1, sol)
            sol.pop()

    for k in range(n):
        backtrack()
```
- This loops through varying lengths and calls backtrack to generate combinations for each length k

## Path-finding in a Graph
Backtracking can also be used to find all possible paths in a graph (or matrix) that satisfy some constraint(s)
- Typically, you can add the node to the candidate, then backtrack into the node, then pop the node from the candidate
- The candidate can be the path or even a visited set

For example, finding whether a word exists in a matrix:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        def backtrack(r, c, word, visited):
            if word == "":
                return True
            directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
            for r_diff, c_diff in directions:
                new_row = r + r_diff
                new_col = c + c_diff
                if 0 <= new_row < m and 0 <= new_col < n and (new_row, new_col) not in visited and word[0] == board[new_row][new_col]:
                    visited.add((new_row, new_col))
                    if backtrack(new_row, new_col, word[1:], visited):
                        return True
                    visited.remove((new_row, new_col))
            return False

        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        for r in range(m):
            for c in range(n):
                if board[r][c] == word[0]:
                    visited = set([(r, c)])
                    if backtrack(r, c, word[1:], visited):
                        return True
        return False
```
- Only call backtrack if the solution is valid; this is why there is an if condition
- Backtracking essentially explores a possible solution until it is completely valid, then the solution is appended to the output
