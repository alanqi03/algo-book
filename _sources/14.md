# Miscellaneous
In this section, I will go over obscure algorithms that are NECESSARY in order to solve some Leetcode Problems optimally. 

## Boyer-Moore Algorithm
This algorithm is only useful for finding the majority element(s) in an array of numbers optimally (O(1) space). 

1. Initialize majority element variable(s) = None and counter variable(s)
2. Iterate through the array, 
    - If the majority element(s) is None, initialize to first element, and increment counter. 
    - Increment the counter by 1 if the element is the majority element(s); else, decrement all by 1. 
    - If the counter becomes 0, and the next element is a different element, change the majority element(s) to next element.
3. Do a second pass to make sure it is a majority element 

Determine the upper limit of majority elements within the constraints and initialize the corresponding number of majority element and counter variables. 
- For example, elements with counts > $\floor{n / 3}$ has at most 2 majority elements, so initialize 2 majority elements. 

### Problems
