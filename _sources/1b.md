# Lists, Sets, Stacks, and Queues
All data structures in this section can be iterated through using `for val in data_structure:` syntax. 

## Lists
Python lists are the equivalent to arrays. 

Python has a wide range of useful built-in functions for lists.
| Method | Description | Input | Output |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `lst.append(x)` | Adds x to the list. | List, Value | None |
| `lst.clear()` | Clears the list | List | None |
| `lst.copy()/lst[:]` | Returns a copy of the list| List | None |
| `lst.count(x)` | Returns number of elements with specified value in list | List, Value | Number |
| `lst.extend(iterable)` | Adds all items in iterable to list | List, Iterable | List |
| `lst.index(value)` | Returns first index of specified value in list | List, Value | Number |
| `lst.insert(index, val)` | Inserts value at index in list | List, Number, Value | None |
| `lst.pop(index)` | Removes and returns element at index (or last element by default) in list | List, Number | Value |
| `lst.remove(value)` | Removes first item with specified value | List, Value | None |
| `lst.reverse()` | Reverses order of list | List | None |
| `lst.sort()` | Sorts the list | List | None |

You can also manipulate lists with slices:
```{code-block} python

lst[x] # value at index x in the list
lst[:] # copy of the list
lst[start:stop:step] # From the start inclusive to stop exclusive with step
```
## Sets
Sets contain no duplicates and are not ordered.

Python has a wide range of useful built-in functions for sets.
| Method | Description | Input | Output |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `set(iterable)` | Converts iterable to a set | Iterable | Set |
| `set.add(x)` | Adds x to the set | Value | None |
| `set.pop()` | Removes random element in the set | Set | None |
| `set.remove(x)` | Removes x from the set | Set, Value | None |
| `set1 & set2` | Intersection of set1 and set2 | Sets | Set |
| `set1 \| set2` | Union of set1 and set2 | Sets | Set |
| `set1 - set2` | Difference of set1 and set2 | Sets | Set |

## Queues
Queues are lists that follow First In, First Out (FIFO) order.

Think about queues as waiting lines for a service. 

You can implement a queue easily in two ways:
1. List ([]) - `append()` and `pop(0)` in O(N) time
2. `from collections import deque`, initialize a deque with `deque(<iterable>)`, `append()` and `popleft()` in O(1) time. 

## Stacks
Stacks are lists that follow the First In, Last Out (FILO) order. 

You can implement a stack easily in two ways:
1. List ([]) - `append()` and `pop()` in O(N) time
2. `from collections import deque`, initialize a deque with `deque(<iterable>)`, `append()` and `pop()` in O(1) time.
