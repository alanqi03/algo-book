# Two Pointers
This section will go over the two pointer approach to solving array problems. 

## When To Use
1. When the input is a sorted array (or as a transformation) and need to find a set of elements to fulfill certain requirements
2. The set of elements in the array is a pair, triplet, or even subarray

## Algorithm
1. Pointer at index first index, pointer at last index
- Sort the array
- Increment left pointer and decrement right pointer for some condition

2. Pointer(s) to store, pointer(s) to move
- Storing pointers only move when index has been filled
- Moving pointers iterate through the array

## Example Problems
1. Valid Palindrome (E)
2. Two Sum II Input Array is Sorted (M)
3. 3Sum (M)
4. Container with Most Water (M)
5. Trapping Rain Water (H)
