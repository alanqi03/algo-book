# Binary Search
This section will go over problems that can be easily solvable using binary search. 

## When to use
1. When we need to find some target value that provides a maximum or minimum solution in a range of values. 
2. Given a sorted array, linked list, matrix, and need to find some target value such that a condition holds true. 
3. If we can discover some kind of monotonicity, for example, if condition(k) is True then condition(k + 1) is True, then we can consider binary search.
- This is most applicable for problems that ask for “finding the minimum” value that satisfies some condition or finding the k-th smallest solution
- This is essentially optimized guess and check


## Algorithm
Here is a basic binary search implementation:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
while left < right:
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid
// Check here for the edge case when l == r
if l == r and arr[l] == target:
    return l
return -1
```
Why not `while left <= right` classic binary search?
- This above implementation avoids the possibility when the target is not found in arr, so the code won't error by going into an infinite loop
- Remember, left is either the target or the element that is >= target 

Here is a binary search implementation for the minimal k satisfying some `condition` function:
- `left` is the MINIMAL k satisfying the `condition` function
- You can also find the MAXIMAL k satisfying some function by INVERTING the `condition` function. For example, finding the maximal value that is <= some value is the same as finding the minimal value that is > some value. Typically, you SHOULD return `left - 1`. 

```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

For maximal conditions:
```{code-block} python
---
linenos:
---
def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left - 1
```

## Bisect Library
A very powerful library in python, called `bisect`, that has multiple operations utilizing binary search.
- `bisect.bisect_left(a, x)` locates the insertion point (index) for x in some list a before any occurrences of x. 
    - `bisect.bisect(a, x)` locates insertion point (index) for x in some list a after all occurrences of x. 
- `bisect.insort_left(a, x)` inserts x into a in sorted fashion (before all occurrences of x)
    - `bisect.insort(a, x)` inserts x into a in sorted fashion (after all occurrences of x)

## General Tips
1. Be careful of certain edge cases such as when the input array only has one element, or when l == r (in the case of `while l < r` implementation)
2. When an input array is sorted, but then shifted/rotated to the right or left by k, binary search can be done with more conditionals (4+) that will allow you to cut down the search space and find target

## Example Problems
1. Binary Search (E)
2. Search a 2D Matrix (M)
3. Koko Eating Bananas (M)
4. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (M)
5. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (M)
6. Time Based Key Value Store (M)
7. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array
