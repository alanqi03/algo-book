# Matrices and Math
Problems involving matrices, 2D arrays, and other mathematical operations involve many different strategies and algorithms to solve them. 
Note: This section will not go over solving problems where matrices are used as a graph representation. 

The sections in this chapter talk about some of the most commonly used algorithms to solve these types of problems. 

## Matrix
### Modifying a Matrix
There are several algorithms to modify a matrix in-place that may help you solve a problem. 
1. Transpose (Across the Main Diagonal)
```
def transpose(matrix):
    for r in range(len(matrix)):
        for c in range(r + 1, len(matrix[0])):
            matrix[r][c], matrix[c][r] = matrix[c][r], matrix[r][c]
```

2. Reverse (Left to Right)
```
def reverse(matrix):
    for r in range(len(matrix)):
        for c in range(len(matrix[0]) // 2):
            matrix[r][c], matrix[r][-1 - c] = matrix[r][-1 - c], matrix[r][c]
```

3. Rotate Matrix Clockwise: Transpose and then Reverse

### General Tips for Matrices
1. Keeping track of the rows and the columns that satisfy some condition may be useful; row set() and col set()

### Problems
1. Rotate Image
2. Spiral Matrix
3. Set Matrix Zeroes
