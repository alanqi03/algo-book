# Shortest Path Algorithms
This section will go over algorithms to find the shortest path between point A and point B, just one of many different applications. 
- They can help determine the length (weight) of shortest path to each node starting from some point A. With this information, 
    - You can calculate the shortest path from point A to any point B
    - The maximum length (weight) of shortest path to some point B will be the minimum length (weight) to traverse every node in the graph for networks (in signals). 
- They can also help with finding other paths such as maximum probability by using a slightly different update for weights. 

One possible shortest path algorithm is DFS, but DFS is typically the most suboptimal algorithm and will not be covered in this section. 

All of the algorithms below can handle the following graphs:
- Directed or undirected graphs
- Positive cycles (if used for shortest path)

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Preconditions for Dijkstra's Algorithm to work:
1. The graph cannot have negative weights. 
2. The graph cannot have negative cycles. 

The steps to conduct Dijkstra's in order to determine the shortest path is as follows:
- Define the adjacency list, a dictionary of node as key and neighbors as a tuple of (values, weight).  
- Initialize a list or dict for each node that has a value of infinity for each value, which signifies the shortest path to node.
- Given a starting point A, set `shortestPath[A] = 0`, and add `(shortestPath[A], A)` to a priority queue (min heap)
- while pq:
    - Pop dist and node from pq
    - For each neighbor of the node, if dist + weight is less than `shortestPath[nei]`, update and add to pq; else, do nothing. 

Now, you should have a shortestPath array to all nodes in the graph, which you can use to solve a bunch of graph problems. 
- You can see which nodes are unreachable if their `shortestPath` is still infinity. 
- You can see the point X that is the farthest away from point A, which is the min combined weight to reach all points (in networks)

    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        neighbors = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y, weight in times: # Create adjacency list
            neighbors[x].append((y, weight)) 
        signalReceivedAt = [float('inf')] * n
        pq = []
        pq.append((0, k))
        heapq.heapify(pq) #Create pq and add point A and dist to pq
        signalReceivedAt[k - 1] = 0 
        while pq:
            dist, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
            for nei, delay in neighbors[node]:
                if dist + delay < signalReceivedAt[nei - 1]: # update
                    signalReceivedAt[nei - 1] = dist + delay
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (signalReceivedAt[nei - 1], nei))
```
Here are some notes about Dijkstra's Algorithm:
- A BFS algorithm for shortest path is essentially the same as Dijkstra's Algorithm excepts it uses a normal queue instead of a priority queue. 
- The time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is `O(ElogN)` and the space complexity is `O(N + E)`
- Dijkstra's Algorithm will always greedily pick the smallest cost's path first regardless of number of edges
    - In some edge cases, you want to force Dijkstra's Algorithm to revisit nodes whose path has less number of edges than the number of edges in its shortest path. 

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm
Advantages of Bellman-Ford Algorithm over Dijkstra's Algorithm
1. Can handle negative weights (edges)
2. Can detect negative cycles.
3. Can limit the number of edges in the shortest path to an arbitrary k. 

Disadvantages of Bellman-Ford Algorithm over Dijkstra's Algorithm
1. Is typically slower because it iterates over all edges `n - 1` times.

The steps to conduct the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to determine the shortest path is as follows:
- Create a list of all edges in the graph. 
- Initialize a list or dict for each node that has a value of infinity for each value, which signifies the shortest path to node.
- Given a starting point A, set `shortestPath[A] = 0`.
- for k times (`k = n - 1` to guarantee shortest path to any node is found)
    - Define a temp array that is a copy of `shortestPath`
    - Iterate through every edge, and update `temp` if `shortestPath[u] + weight < temp[v]`
- After k times, you should have the `shortestPath` fully defined; if any node still has infinity, then it is unreachable in k edges.

class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n, flights, src, dst, k):
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        dist[src] = 0
        temp = []
        for i in range(k + 1): 
            temp = dist[:] # Make a copy, don't assign a pointer
            for u, v, price in flights:
                if dist[u] + price < temp[v]:
                    temp[v] = dist[u] + price
            dist = temp[:] 
        if dist[dst] == float('inf'):
            return -1
        return dist[dst]
```
Here are some notes on the algorithm:
- You can detect a negative cycle if instead of iterating through all edges `n-1` times, run through it one more `nth` time:
    - If an update is completed, then there is a negative cycle.
    - Otherwise, there are no negative cycles. 
- For a small optimization that can handle edges cases in certain problems, abort the loop if no edges update anything.
