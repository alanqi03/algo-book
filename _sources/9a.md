# Knapsack DP
Several DP problems asks you to solve the following problem (or similar variations):

Given N items where each item has some weight and profit associated with it and also given a bag with capacity W, [i.e., the bag can hold at most W weight in it]. The task is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of profits associated with them is the maximum possible. 

There are two possible choices for one item:
- You can either take the item and place it in the bag OR don't take the item

Of course, there are various conditions that you have to consider, but that is the general gist of 0/1 knapsack problems.
