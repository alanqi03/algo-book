# Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

# A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
